4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The project was quite hard to understand, most of the spent time was for understanding what I had
   to do, writing the codes wasn't that hard but grasping the concepts was almost impossible for me.
   I hope you guys make it easier for the upcoming students. Thanks :)"
